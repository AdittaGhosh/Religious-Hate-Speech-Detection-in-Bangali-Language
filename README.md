Information and communication technology has transformed promptly over
the last decades, with a key development being the emergence of social
media. The pace of change is accelerating; the commencement of mobile
technology played as a catalyst in shaping the impact of social media. Day by
day people are getting more attached to it. While networking is being
boosted, there has been a sharp rise in cyberbullying in social media as well.
Thus, communal attacks on the minority have become easier than before.
Moreover, rumors spread from many accounts which result in communal
violence and riots. Hence it is highly indispensible to make a system that can
automatically detect these types of hate speech on social media to help stop
the aggravation. Although many works already have been done on
identifying hate speech there are very few works have been done on religious
hate speech specifically on Bengali (Bangla) language. Therefore, the goal of
this research is to provide a clever framework for identifying religious hate
speech on social media. We have collected 4370 hate speech data from
different online resources which contain 1913 hate speech tagged as religious
hate speech. We implemented our proposed model to predict and compared
the result with MLP and Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and
Naive Bayes methods.Â Among these four models, Support Vector Machine
performed very well with an accuracy of 70.3%.
